        quote: "Hearing from Sharon’s heart is like hearing the sound from a soul who has known life well—and lived it exceedingly well. Not only does Sharon know the scripture and how it relates to us today, she also knows pain and grief. She is well acquainted with both—and that makes her more related to everyone else. I love to hear her teach—compact, engaging, challenging,  vulnerable, always speaking upward, never ‘down to.’ And who doesn’t long for that? I am never disappointed. To hear her speak on the grace of God, the challenges of life, the reality of God’s provision in tough times—well, it invites me deeper into the heart of God. What a stellar woman of faith!\"",

        quote: "Sharon is one of the realest, rawest deliverers of God’s Word that I have had the pleasure of sitting under many times over. When I first moved to Colorado, to plant a church with my husband, Passionate Hearts was the first women’s ministry that reached out to me. I attended a few of Sharon’s events and it was so refreshing to hear someone bring their life experiences, good and bad, into the studies and not be ashamed of how they got where they are, through the refining fire. It was nice to know I wasn’t the only one going through certain things. Ever since, Sharon has headlined several women’s events for my church. I look forward to hearing her teach for many years to come.\"",

        quote: "I have had the privilege of hearing Sharon teach in a variety of different formats, for many years. From MOPS to Women's Retreats, leadership training, conferences, and even one on one coaching, Sharon has been a valued teacher to me and those I minister to and with. I trust that her heart is sold out for Jesus, His Word, and ministering to others in transparency. Sharon's speaking style is hospitable and powerful.  I know that when she addresses a group, she will touch nearly every season of life and find a commonality with the people in the room.  Sharon is engaging, fun, and truthful.  Her messages have always been applicable and timely. Sharon recently was a Keynote speaker for a Women's Brunch and I am asked regularly when she will be back!  If you want to touch the heart of your audience and connect them to Jesus, Sharon is gifted at helping you do just that.\"",

She is authentic, vulnerable and can laugh at herself which puts everyone at ease. She shares from examples from her own life ladies can relate to. Her knowledge of Scripture and solid teaching lays a firm foundation for every word spoken and when anointed by God, ushers in transformation and renewal. Humble, bold, endearing and a confident, organized speaker, she pulls no punches and is a tremendous gift to the body of Christ!\"",
